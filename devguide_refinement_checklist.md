# Devguide Refinement Checklist

- [ ] List out the pre-requisites to understand the devguide.
- [ ] Tutorial Video for the devloper guide 
- [ ] Emphasis on the goal of the devloper guide. 
- [ ] One or Two lines on the locust tool and the link to the locust website to be given for further exploration.
- [ ] Claridfication in locustfile about the code snippet being an example of how locustfile and its output looks like and no coding required by the devloper at this time when following the devguide.
- [ ] Mention a code snippet on how to run a locustfile.(Use the one from the robot file)
- [ ] Find out and mention why do we need to add `resources.csv` is needed. Mention to copy paste the code to the csv file.
- [ ] Add link to read more about python virtual environments.
- [ ] Mention oxygen also installs robotframework package because, robot is fetched while installing oxygen lib.
- [ ] Consider re-ordering where to introduce the locustfile. (It could be done later when we write the code for locustfile.)
- [ ] Emphasis (by making it bold) on running commmand line from the right directory everytime we run a code. It is easy to miss and lose flow from developer guide.
- [ ] Tree directory structure could be a nice way to exlpain where to run the code every time. 
- [ ] Where do I install the demo app - do it whereever you want. It doesnt matter. But it is important explicitly mention a directory so that user don't lose flow of concepts of gets stuck.
