# Oxygen 1.0

Oxygen is a [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) library that empowers the user to convert the results of any testing framework to the [robot framework's test results](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/2.1.2/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#created-outputs). 

Oxygen 1.0 has built-in parsers for 3 testing frameworks. 

1. [JUnit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JUnit) - unit testing framework for Java.
2. [Gatling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatling_(software)) - load and performance testing framework.
3. [Zed Attack Proxy(ZAP)](https://www.zaproxy.org/) - web security tool. 

Additionally, users can add your own parsers for any other testing framework tools to get the results in the robot framework's test results.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Oxygen requires `Python 3.0` or above to be installed in the environment the oxygen tool is to be deployed. 

Check the Python version on the command line:
```
python --version
```

Upgrade the python version if python version is less than `Python 3.0`. Follow the link for [python3](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) installation.

##### IMPORTANT!! --  Oxygen 1.0 requires the git repository to be cloned to a directory where there is no 'spaces' in the directory path.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
