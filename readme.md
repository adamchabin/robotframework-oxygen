# Oxygen 1.0

Oxygen is a [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) library that empowers the user to convert the results of any testing framework to the [robot framework's test results](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/2.1.2/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#created-outputs). 

Oxygen 1.0 has built-in parsers for 3 testing frameworks. 

1. [JUnit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JUnit) - unit testing framework for Java.
2. [Gatling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatling_(software)) - load and performance testing framework.
3. [Zed Attack Proxy(ZAP)](https://www.zaproxy.org/) - web security tool. 

Additionally, users can add your own parsers for any other testing framework tools to get the results in the robot framework's test results.
